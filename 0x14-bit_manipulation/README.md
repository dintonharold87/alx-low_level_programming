## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use _putchar

### Tasks
File 0-binary_to_uint.c is a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

File 1-print_binary.c is a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

File 2-get_bit.c is a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

File 3-set_bit.c is a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

File 4-clear_bit.c is a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

File 5-flip_bits.c is a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

File 100-get_endianness.c is a function that checks if the machine is Little Endian or Big Endian.

File 101-password is a password for the program ./crackme3.

File main.h is the header file containing all the function prototypes of this project.
