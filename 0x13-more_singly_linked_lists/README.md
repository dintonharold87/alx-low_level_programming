# 0x13-More_singly_linked_lists
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc,exit and free.
* Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* All your header files should be include guarded
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
### Tasks
File 0-print_listint.c is a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

File 1-listint_len.c is a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.

File 2-add_nodeint.c is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

File 3-add_nodeint_end.c is a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.

File 4-free_listint.c is a function that frees a listint_t list.

File 5-free_listint2.c is a function that frees a listint_t list and sets the head pointer to NULL.

File 6-pop_listint.c is  a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head node’s data (n).

File 7-get_nodeint.c is a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

File 8-sum_listint.c is a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.

File 9-insert_nodeint.c is a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

File 10-delete_nodeint.c is a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.

File 100-reverse_listint.c is a function that reverses a linked list.

File 101-print_listint_safe.c is a function that prints a listint_t linked list, safely.

File 102-free_listint_safe.c is a function that frees a listint_t list, safely.

File 103-find_loop.c is a function that finds the loop in a linked list.

File lists.h is the header file containing all these function prototypes and the data structure listint_t.
